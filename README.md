##  Welcome to My Coding Playground! ️

I'm Plango, a programmer who's been building things in code for the past 8 years .  I started my journey in the blocky world of Roblox , but my curiosity has led me to explore a wide range of languages like C++, Python, C, and Java !

**What I've Built:**

*  Games (think Roblox awesomeness and beyond! )
*  Machine Learning (teaching computers to be super smart! )
*  Kernel Game Cheats (Shh... it's for educational purposes only ) - Minecraft clients and plugins ⛏️

**Current Project: AstraSkies **

Get ready to blast off to a whole new world!   I'm teaming up with a partner to build AstraSkies, a fully custom-coded Skyblock server ️. Inspired by legendary servers like Cosmic Sky and Hypixel ✨, we're crafting an epic adventure for you to conquer .

**Looking Ahead:**

My coding journey is never-ending!    I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to collaborate with other passionate programmers .  Feel free to reach out if you have a cool project in mind, or just want to chat code .
